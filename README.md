# Tugas Akhir Data Science

## Dataset Preparation
Save the clean dataset as rumahcom_clean.csv in the project directory.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Train the model and perform hyperparameter tuning:

```python train_model.py```

The trained model will be saved as model_cache.joblib.

## Predicting House Prices
To predict house prices for new data:

Edit the new_data dictionary in the train_model.py file with the desired values.

Run the script again:

```python train_model.py```

## Accuracy
The model still lack on accuracy, and will be update soon.
